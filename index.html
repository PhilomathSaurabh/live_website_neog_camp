  <h1>Welcome to Saurabh Pandey's Playground to web development</h1>
  <h1>If I try to do it in real time will it change?? </h1>
  <h2>Yes it did changed!!! heheh The live code thing is real fun!!! </h2>

  <p>I am creating this blog to showcase what all I have created in these days of web development</p>

<h3>Some of the imp tips Sir gave during the lecture</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create compoennt library for twitter</li>
  <li>Start using states in different website</li>
  <li>Take any website and make a component library in that</li>
  <li>Practice more and more</li>
  <li>THe best is when you go to website which no one knows, make component library for that</li> 
  <li>When you visit different sites you will see the same component getting repeated again and again. They make component libarry</li>
  <li>You also have to replicate the same. </li>
<li>Learn to follow the symmetry in desing. Don't go haywire in creating multiple types of buttons.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Create a Div</li>
  <li>Now you have to create a list beacuse a Nav bar contains multiple items.</li>

  <li>get the link to that image.</li>
  <li>copy the source and paste it into the code.</li>
  <li>Get the image on the internet from websites</li>
  <li>If you are not able to do what is being taught, you can always go to codepen and code snippets there</li>
  <li>learn using img tag in the code pen website</li>
  <li>dont use public images of differnet person even if its public :P Use coredraw website!! All images are free.</li>
  <li>Another Source of images - UnSpash </li>
</ol>

<h2>Doubts remaining in the lecture?</h2>

</ul>

<h3>Sections?</h3>
<div>Sections are also tag. It shows that your page has diff things.</div>
<ol>
  <li>Section will clearly divide the page into multiple parts.</li>
  <li>Best thing is that html and CSS is completely open and you can directly copy paste from any website and you can know how to create that!!!! AMAZING AND AWESOME!!!!</li>
  <li>You can understand the formatting of page, eg wikipedia page on India</li>
  <li>You can understand any source code, look into wikepeida, microsoft, they have used the symantec tags perfectly and you will be able to learn a lot from these. </li>
  <li>Lets start using section.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>@Section</h3>
<div>the most amazing thing about section is that it will expand to the entire page, end to end.</div>
<div>Section cna have headings, paragraphs etc anything.</div>
<div>Below you will see examples of sections</div>

<hr>

<h4>learn more</h4>
<ol><li>
  Anything that is there in head is not visible.
</li>
<li>read more about the meta tags.</li>
<li>If you are not able to absorb then no problem but go ahead.</li>
<li>Starters code for 10 - 12 hours per day to learn more of coding.</li>
<li>INline vs Block</li>
<li>See headings - it is taking entire row. This is block element</li>
<li>Go to the secondsary links - this will take just text image shape. This will not take whole space. So this is taking space of its own, so this is inline elelemt.</li>
<li>Footer and Section</li>
<li>If you have peices of elements which are of same theme but disjointed little bit, then you can use sections to make it more understandable.</li>
<li>eg WWII</li>
<li>You will have to udnerstand multiple things - background, during the war, post war treateis, present situation - all of these can be multiple sections</li>
<li>look for asise in html</li>
<li>you dont need to use javascript to have a working website!! Dont just go after what market says!</li>
<li>If still you are not able to understand inline and block elements - go to mdn wesite and read and learn from there</li>
</ol>


<hr>
<h3>Using Footer</h3>
<div>We have footer tag to be directly used in html</div>

<footer>
